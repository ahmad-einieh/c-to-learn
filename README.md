# c-to-learn
Write a C program assignment.c that asks the user to enter a number of integer values to process. The program then should read these values from the keyboard and assure each of them is unique, and finally print their average. The program should store the grades in a dynamically allocated array and visit its elements using pointer arithmetic.
